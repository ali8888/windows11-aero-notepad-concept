## Windows 11's notepad, with a non transparent dark aero theme!

# Disclaimer 
This is not an actual usable theme nor an actual app but a visual concept that reacts to mouse hover actions.

You can try it out [here](https://ali8888.github.io/windows11-aero-notepad-concept/)

Mainly inspired from Windows Media Player 11.
Concept made with <span>Paint.NET</span>, GameMaker Studio 2.

Would be cool if the Aero style was preserved on later Windows releases, but alas, flat design was used instead to help make UI in general look more readable.. at the cost of looking pretty..
